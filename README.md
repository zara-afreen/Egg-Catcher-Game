# Egg-Catcher-Game

This game is to test your concentration and the speed of your reflexes. Don't crack under pressure, just catch as many aggs as you can to get a high score. Challenge your friends to see who is the champion egg catcher.

This program uses Tkinter to draw and move shapes, and the random module to place them on the screen.

## How it Works
Once the background is created, the eggs gradually move down the screen, which creates the illusion that they are falling. Using loops, the code continually checks the coordinates of the eggs to see if any have hit the bottom or been caught in the catcher. When an egg is caught or dropped, it is deleted and the program adjusts the score or the number of remaining lives.

## Arcade-style game
This project brings all your coding skills together to create an impressive arcade-style game. The code is quite comples for beginners, so check you code carefully for bugs at each stage and don't be discouraged if you make a few mistakes along the way. Once you’ve cracked Egg Catcher, you’ll be all set to start making your own games.

## Hacks aand Tweaks
To make the game look even better, you can try adding some cool scenery of your own. Fun sounds and music are another great way to make the game more exciting.
